pyliquid
========

Reimplementation of the ruby liquid template lib.
For the ruby version of liquid template visit https://github.com/Shopify/liquid

Quickstart
----------

For a fast painless start pyliquid uses buildout. Just execute the following
commands and you get a working instance.

* git co git://github.com/refnode/pyliquid.git
* cd pyliquid
* python bootstrap.py
* bin/buildout

After executing the commands you will find all executables in the bin/
subfolder.
