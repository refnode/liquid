liquid
======

Reimplementation of the ruby liquid template lib.

Quickstart
----------

For a fast painless start pyliquid uses buildout. Just execute the following
commands and you get a working instance.

* git co https://github.com/refnode/liquid.git
* cd liquid
* make

After executing the commands you will find all executables in the bin/
subfolder.

As a workaround for outdated setuptools, execute the following commands on debian based distributions:

* sudo apt-get install python-pip
* sudo pip install -U distribute
